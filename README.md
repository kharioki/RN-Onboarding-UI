# RN-Onboarding-UI

An app showing how to implement onboarding screens in Expo React Native.

This app uses [react-native-app-intro-slider](https://github.com/Jacse/react-native-app-intro-slider) to implement onboard slider.

Shoutout to [Made with Matt](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHgS0H3T3459H1e9QWK_Ezg) Youtube channel for the inspiration. Checkout his channel for the Bare React Native implementation of this same project.
